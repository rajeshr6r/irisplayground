# Produtionizing ML models with single page web apps

## Technologies used 
<br>

>Docker - For containerizing all necessary requirements for the app

>GitHub Docker Integration - For automatic image build with repository commit

> Python Flask - For rendering a single page app with the models loaded on the background 

> Azure Container Instanes - To demonstrate how to consume a docker container on internet.

> HTML - For the single web app

## I have another repository that uses streamlit for the same IRIS Data Set 

### If you are interested please visit [here](https://github.com/rajeshr6r/irisplaygroundstreamlit)


## Disclaimer 

This repository is not a Machine Learning Tutorial . But a tutorial to demonstrate how quickly one can productionize Machine Learing Models with minimal effort.

Also for dockers I'm running a limited base UBUNTU image . Note that it is not always the right choice . For example if you are running libraries like H2O , Tensorflow or PyTorch then the image can get heavier. And slimming up your docker image is an art by itself . Happy Hunting . 

Please drop a note if you find anything simpler.

Update : 14Feb2021 : I used a python3 image that under the hoods use a debian buster image . However this script might make it helpful for someone who is from a non-linux side. It simply uses the python and its dependencies .

## Wish to cut the english and jump into action ? 

> You can do that by simply pulling the docker image with the following command and then running it as follows

~~~
docker pull rajeshr6routlook/irisplayground:latest

docker run -itd -p 8000:8000 rajeshr6routlook/irisplayground:latest
~~~

> or if you'd like the python only ( which is not true as underneath the python image uses debian buster )

~~~ 
docker pull rajeshr6routlook/pythonirisplayground:latest

docker run -itd -p 8000:8000 rajeshr6routlook/pythonirisplayground:latest

~~~
